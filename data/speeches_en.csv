Statement by President of Ukraine  at the United Nations General Assembly Debate on agenda item 67  “The situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine”
",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vistup-prezidenta-ukrayini-na-debatah-generalnoyi-asambleyi-53282,20 February 2019  - 18:18,"Madam President,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to President of the UN General Assembly María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés for her leadership in steering the work of the UN main policymaking and representative body.  
Today marks the fifth anniversary of the start of the foreign military aggression against my country, Ukraine.
I want to express my gratitude to the UN General Assembly, which for over these past years has been taking a strong stand in support of Ukraine, in opposing aggression and occupation.  
Five years ago hundred innocent lives, not only Ukrainians, but also Belarusians, Armenians, Jews and many others were lost in the name of Ukraine’s independence, dignity and freedom.
When after the loss of the Heavenly Hundred in Kyiv the UN General Assembly adopted the resolution on territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine with hundred votes in favor, it was not only symbolic – it was the right thing to do.
This Assembly proved its meaningful role in discussing questions related to the maintenance of international peace and security.
Every year when I came to address annual session of the General Assembly, I felt great sympathy to the Ukrainian people.
And, the sympathy underpinned with practical steps.
It was the case, when the General Assembly, without any loss of time, adopted a resolution in March 2014 reiterating Ukraine’s sovereignty within internationally recognized borders.
It was a timely reaction to Russia’s illegal attempts to redraw the borders in Europe with the illegal annexation of Crimea.
It was also the case, when – now for a third year in a row – the General Assembly adopts the resolution on the human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.
Unbelievable for many, but this resolution recognizes Russia, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, as an occupying power.
It was also the case, when just a few months ago the General Assembly supported Ukraine’s request and adopted a resolution condemning the militarization of Crimea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.
I am grateful for maintaining such a close attention of the Assembly to Ukraine and our region, in where Russia is getting extremely aggressive - both on the land and on the sea.
The UN’s ability to address properly this challenge will have, without any doubt, a direct impact on the future of the rules-based international order.  
Today’s consideration by the UN General Assembly of a new agenda item ”Situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine” is a clear testimony of Assembly’s readiness to address pressing issues.
 
Madam President,
On this very day in 2014, Russia started its covert military invasion in Ukraine in clear violation of norms and principles of the UN Charter.
On March the 3rd this war claimed its first victim: Reshat Ametov - a Crimean Tatar.
He went on a peaceful one-man protest against aggression.
Russians detained him, tortured and murdered him.
The cause of the death: stab in the eye.
This was just the beginning of the horror in the Russian occupied Crimea.
Just think about the fact that for five years the Ukrainian people have been living amid the longest hot conflict in Europe in modern history.
Russia has started the war against its neighbor, whom it calls «brotherly», and it is showing no intention to stop.
Almost daily, we lose our best sons and daughters.
This is what my heart bleeds about every given day.
This is what I would never be able to accept.
First, Russia grabbed Crimea, then it turned Donbas into a battlefield, and then it continued its aggression in the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea and the Kerch Strait.   
As a result, 44 000 square km, or 7% of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea and eastern parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, are currently under occupation.
The Russian aggression has left 13 thousand people killed and more than 28 thousand wounded. This number also includes 298 passengers of flight MH17, shot down in July 2014 by the Russian military from a BUK missile system.
More than 1.8 million residents of Crimea and Donbas had to leave their homes due to Russia’s aggression and occupation.
The once peaceful life of the people in these regions has now turned into a nightmare – marked by fear and terror.
Yet, they have never turned into a wave of immigrants, and created no problem to our European allies.
We have managed to cope with the challenge and prove that a government-controlled part of Ukraine is much more resilient and healthy than an occupied one.
As in any war, the first casualty of Moscow’s aggression was the truth.
The occupation started with infamous “little green men” and Kremlin’s outright and shameful denial of its military involvement in the takeover of the Ukrainian Crimea.
Instead, the world and the public were fed with lies about “mythical local self-defense units”, which somehow overnight became equipped with the latest Russian weaponry.  
Only later, the Russian President publicly admitted that it had indeed been the operation by the Russian military.
Putin’s confession makes the Russian narrative regarding the so-called “local referendum” a surreal one.
The vote was held at a gunpoint, and it was nothing but part of the Russia’s aggressive plan.
Let me repeat: the referendum in March 2014 was a fake.
I witnessed it myself when I was in Crimea in late February 2014.
I came right at the door of the Crimean Parliament to talk and to stop the farce. Alone. Without any security. I saw myself that it was encircled by the Russian military.  
It has absolutely nothing to do with democracy, nor with the free will of people.
Russia also wanted to spread chaos to all eastern and southern regions of Ukraine.
It was only the resistance of our people, who refused to be victims of the “Russian word” that stopped further occupation.
Unfortunately, direct military intervention by Russian regular troops in Donbas has led to the occupation of parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.  
On April 13th 2014, this war claimed its first victim in Donbas.
His name was Hennadiy Bilichenko.
He was a Ukrainian officer, a part of the group that had strict orders “not to respond to provocations”.
Back then we had an illusion that the war was still avoidable.
This group was ambushed near the city of Sloviansk.
Hennadiy died from a gun fire.
Six days later, the same Russian officers detained Volodymyr Rybak, a local politician in Horlivka who wanted to raise Ukrainian flag in his town.
Alongside with him was 19-year-old activist Yuriy Popravko.
They tortured them, then split their stomachs open and pushed them, still alive, in a river.
This is how Russia’s war in Donbas started.
We know who did this! We know how they did this!
The Kremlin continues to deny any involvement of the Russian military in the war in Donbas, despite the overwhelming evidence proving the opposite.
Only recently 21 Russian military men, who were captured on the battlefield and are currently in Ukrainian custody, pleaded with president Putin to exchange them for Ukrainian political prisoners in Russia.
The Kremlin has not reacted. It shows just how much careless the Russian authorities are about those whom they sent to this undeclared war.
Five years onwards, Moscow continues to send its regular military forces and proxies to Donbas.
Donbas literally became a production line for Russia’s killing machine.
As cynical as it is, they even send their young military cadets to Donbas to get practice in the battlefield.
In mothers’ place, I would ask Russian president where their sons are?
Last November the Russian naval forces committed a direct, brutal and unprovoked attack on Ukrainian warships in the international waters of the Black Sea.
Russia’s actions fall exactly under the definition of aggression according to UN General Assembly Resolution of 1974.
As a result, the vessels were damaged and seized, 24 crew members, including     3 wounded, were captured and are now in illegal detention in Russia.
I want to stress that they are not criminals; they must be treated as prisoners of war under Geneva Conventions.
But Russia turns a deaf ear to numerous calls for their immediate and unconditional release, including those contained in the resolution adopted by this General Assembly last December.
Today I brought with myself an appeal to the Secretary General to press on Moscow to release the Ukrainian crewmembers.
It was signed by thousands of Ukrainians over the last few days. And I speak on behalf of all of them. We sincerely count on your support.
This is a call signed by Ukrainian leaders. And this is the list of signatures. Which are now here in New York. And I give it to the Secretary-General.
Moscow’s hybrid war also includes covert operations and hacker attacks against Ukrainian institutions and critical civilian infrastructure.
This kind of Russian activity is by now well-known far beyond Ukraine’s borders.
In addition, Russia wages unprecedented propaganda war against Ukraine – a war that has actually started before the first victims died on Kyiv’s Maidan square.
Every day, with no pause or consideration for holidays and weekends, all of Russia’s major TV channels broadcast torrents of lies and fake news about Ukraine.
These lies especially target the population of occupied territories, where the Ukrainian TV and radio channels are being blocked.     
It’s a virtual state-run hate machine working 24/7.
Ukraine is topic #1, #2 and #3 in the Russian news and talk-shows.
They treat Ukraine as a domestic, not foreign issue.
Five years ago, this war began under the pretext of defending Russian-speakers in Ukraine.
It goes on now under the pretext of defending the Orthodox believers.
President Putin publicly confirmed his readiness to use military force for this purpose in response to Ukraine creating its own independent Orthodox church.   
While continuing its undeclared war against my country the Kremlin desperately keeps trying to convince the international community that it is not a party to the conflict.
It says, it is Ukraine’s internal conflict, where Russia is only an objective and impartial mediator.
It is a truly twisted reality that the Russian Federation tries to spread.
Some may be tempted to go along with the Russian narrative for the sake of political convenience.
I stand here today to let you know that we will not let the lies prevail.
We will fight tooth and nail to prevent any and all attempts to present the Russian aggressive behavior towards my country as anything else but what they actually are – a war waged in plain sight of the international community.
Let’s set the record straight once and for all. There is no so-called “crisis in Ukraine” nor “internal conflict in Ukraine”, but an ongoing military occupation and armed aggression by Russia against Ukraine.
It is noteworthy that the report of the ICC leading prosecutor recognized conflict in Crimea and Donbas as armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea as an ongoing state of occupation. These are ICC’s words.
It’s truly mind-boggling that even after all these decisions the Russian Federation is still trying to present itself as a peaceful state that fully implements its obligations under the UN Charter.
There are no so-called “de-facto authorities” but the Russian occupation administration in the temporarily occupied territories of Donbas and Crimea, as well as Russian state bodies and agencies, which are in charge of administering these occupied territories.
There are no rebels but Russian regular armed forces under the Defense Ministry and formations of special and secret services.  
There are no insurgents but Russian advisors, instructors, irregular illegal armed groups created, equipped, funded and controlled by Russia.
Madam President,
For your better understanding of the price paid by Ukraine for its freedom and democracy, I would like to share with you some figures, which speak for themselves.
By February 2019, in the occupied Crimea Russia has deployed up to 32.5 thousand military personnel, 88 artillery systems, 52 multiple launch rocket systems, 372 armored combat vehicles, 113 warplanes, 62 combat helicopters, as well as 6 combat ships and 6 submarine ships equipped with sea launch cruise missiles “Caliber”.
One cannot exclude eventual deployment of nuclear weapons in the peninsula. The infrastructure is already there, and Russia has used the past five years to restore and modernize it.
Thus, we are witnessing an unprecedented militarization of the Black Sea area.
Russia changes the strategic balance in the region and well beyond its borders. It turns Crimea into a launch pad for its missiles. Does anybody still have illusions about why Russia had done everything to ruin the INF Treaty? Don’t be naïve: Russia transforms into a military base any land it grabs or take under its control.
In Donbas, Russian armed formations have 496 tanks. Please know that this number is bigger than that of Germany or France, Spain or Italy. And it is Ukraine who contains this Russian force, that also has 938 armored combat vehicles, 128 Multiple Launch Rocket System,    776 artillery systems (including self-propelled ones). It makes Ukraine a true Eastern flank of NATO in defense of trans-Atlantic freedom and democracy.  
Last year the OSCE Special monitoring mission in Donbas on several occasions took video coverage of convoys of the Russian military hardware, illegally crossing the section of the Ukrainian-Russian border not controlled by the Ukraine authorities.
Monitors also determined the presence in the occupied territory of the newest Russian systems of radio electronic warfare and radio intelligence as well as electronic UAV jamming systems.
These systems have never been in a possession of the Ukrainian armed forces. There is only one country capable to produce and supply them: Russia!
To hide these illegal supplies, the Russian Federation simply blocks the SMM OSCE monitoring activities in the areas, close to the temporarily uncontrolled segment of the state border.
The SMM also continues to suffer from huge restrictions on its every day activity in the occupied territory.
Taking the opportunity, I would like to express my gratitude to all nations that actively contribute to the SMM OSCE work.
Back to the figures, I have to underline that the overall number of illegal armed formations stands now at around 35 thousand militants, along with 2 100 servicemen from Russian regular armed forces.
The total number of the Russian armed forces along the Russian-Ukrainian border is over 87 000 military.
Military experts would tell it straight that an armed grouping at the Russian border with Ukraine is an offensive strike group personnel. It has nothing to do with defense. They are meant for military strike. This is what the Kremlin is being prepared for.
Thus, further escalation to a full-scale war is not an unrealistic prospect.
That is why we should ensure a comprehensive, a real-time monitoring of the situation along the Russian border with Ukraine. Knowing the aggressor as I know him, I would like to assure you that most of all he is afraid of transparency, public attention and the world knowing his plans.
The price we pay for the Russian adventure in Donbas has a wide-raging and multidimensional character.
Apart of the direct military consequences, Ukraine is facing now the most serious humanitarian challenges since independence.
Critical infrastructure facilities, electricity, gas and water supplies, damaged by shellings require urgent repair.
Civilians continue to face serious risks to their safety due to the saturation of landmines and other explosive ordnances in the occupied Donbas.
This area, according to the UN, has already become the most mine-contaminated stretches of land in the world.
To overcome humanitarian consequences of the Russian military aggression, over the last five year UN agencies have mobilized more than USD 460 million.
We are grateful for the assistance provided by our international partners to millions of people in need.
The economic and environmental damages caused by the Russian occupation are also immense.
27% of Donbas industrial potential has been illegally moved to Russia, including the equipment of 33 local industrial giants.
The remaining enterprises cannot be fully operational because of the lack of professional staff, financial resources and the loss of cooperation ties with other parts of Ukraine.    
The ecological situation in the occupied Donbas is also deteriorating, in particular due to the flooding of coalmines, which pose a risk of water contamination.
There are a number of potentially dangerous objects near the line of contact which, due to regular shelling by armed formations of the Russian Federation, could become an epicenter of the ecological and technological disaster.
And this is not a complete list of the problems brought to our land by the Russian aggression.
 
Madam President,
I’d like to draw your attention to the human rights situation in the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine – people, our citizens, continue to suffer from Russian aggression on a daily basis.
Murder, torture, harassment, sexual violence, arbitrary detentions and arrests, enforced disappearances and persecution of journalists, human rights defenders, social media workers and bloggers have become a daily reality for the residents of the occupied territories.
People live in fear of being labeled as extremists, terrorists or Ukrainian spies and risk being thrown behind bars or abducted without a trace.
The occupation administrations have introduced disgusting practice of extracting under torture false confessions in politically motivated prosecutions.
The free exercise of religion is also under threat there.
Recently the occupation authorities demanded to clear the church building in Simferopol that belonged to the Ukrainian Orthodox worshipers for many years.
The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission, invited by the Government of Ukraine, continue reporting the growing number of human rights violations and abuses in the temporarily occupied territories.
Effective implementation of its mandate is hindered by the Russia’s continued denial of access for UN monitors to the occupied Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
In April 2017, the International Court of Justice adopted a provisional measures order in the case of Ukraine vs. Russian Federation.
In its decision, the ICJ urged Russia to refrain from maintaining or imposing limitations on the ability of the Crimean Tatar community to conserve its representative institutions, including the Mejlis, and to ensure the right for Ukrainian citizens to study Ukrainian language.
Like so many other decisions within this Organization, including those adopted by this August Assembly, the Court’s binding Order remains unimplemented by the Russian Federation.
The issues related to the Russian unlawful behavior against Ukraine and its people are now considered by the International Criminal Court, International Court of Justice, European Court of Human Rights and in the framework of the arbitration proceedings under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
In this light, I highly appreciate a remarkable manifestation of support and solidarity with Ukraine throughout the world.
We also need to double down seeking the release of over 70 Ukrainian hostages held in Russia and in Crimea, and the exchange of detainees envisages by the Minsk arrangements.
Only last year Ukraine transmitted to Russia 13 proposals regarding a potential detainee’s swap. Kremlin turned its back to all of them.
I am convinced that even though the Kremlin remains blind and deaf the international pressure and inevitable responsibility for grave violations of human rights is the only way to stop Moscow abuses in this sphere.
I call upon all your countries to strengthen efforts in demanding respect for human rights by the Russian Federation, along with unconditional release and return of all Ukrainian hostages and prisoners of war.
 
Madam President,
Ukraine is a peace-loving nation with no expansionary plans or territorial claims.
No inch of Russia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity was violated by us.
Utmost respect for the UN Charter and for the OSCE Helsinki principles has been the foundation of our foreign policy since independence.
To underline the point, I would like to draw your attention to the events of December 1994 in Budapest, when Ukraine gave up the third largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world in exchange for security assurances.
In 2014, our goodwill was repaid by a stab in the back by one of the signatories of the Budapest Memorandum – the Russian Federation.
By resorting to the military aggression against Ukraine, Russia violated all possible fundamental norms and principles of international law, including the UN Charter.
The Charter, which entrusts Security Council members to uphold international peace and security instead of unleashing conflicts throughout the world.
So what could the international community do as regards Russia?
For instance, in 1939, for its aggressive behavior, Moscow was expelled from the League of Nations – a right and justified move.
Maybe it is time to put Russia in its place – start with depriving it of its veto right, at least when it comes to issues related to the Russian aggression against Ukraine?
What else could we do in order to bring peace to Ukraine and find a long-lasting solution to the Russian aggression?
Back in March 2015, I requested the UN Security Council to deploy in the territory of Ukraine a peacekeeping operation under the mandate of the UN Security Council.
This initiative was blocked by the Russian Federation, which rejected a possibility for a full-fledged UN involvement to resolve the conflict.
The Russian Federation distorted the very idea and objectives of a peacekeeping operation in Ukraine.
I am still a strong believer that an UN-mandated multinational peacekeeping operation with a clear objective to end the Russian aggression and restore Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity could be a decisive factor in bringing peace to Donbas.
We are ready for a constructive discussion of this initiative.
And a Technical assessment mission which the UN Secretary General could send to Donbas in order to elaborate respective options would definitely assist to this discussion.
For Ukraine, it is a matter of principle that any decision on establishing a peacekeeping operation in Donbas extend its mandate over the entire occupied territory, including border, and provide for withdrawal of Russian troops and proxies and their weaponry from our territory, as well as dissolution of all illegal bodies and structures.
It is also important that any peacekeeping operation is based on key UN peacekeeping principles – to be impartial, unbiased, and neutral in the first place.
I would like to assure you that such a mission does not contradict the Minsk arrangements as Russia tries to present it.
It would, instead, greatly assist in making Russia fulfil the Minsk arrangements in good faith.
Ukraine has always demonstrated goodwill with real steps to go further on.
And what we received in return – nothing! Aggression continues!
Because Russia is not interested in the settlement at all!
It does not care for Donbas or Crimea!
It needs all of Ukraine to restore the Soviet Union second edition!
The Ukrainian people are not going to give up on their hard-won independence and bend the knee before the aggressor.  
The Russian aggression will be over once the Kremlin leadership decides to stop it and to withdraw its troops from Ukraine’s territory and to return the control of Ukraine-Russia state border to where it belongs.
I would like to remind everyone: when you call on Russia to stop fighting, you call for ending the war, and when you call on Ukraine to stop fighting for defending itself, you call for giving up Ukraine’s sovereignty.
 
Madam President,
Looking back from a 5-year retrospective, I have to reconfirm that there is no alternative to a peaceful settlement of this international conflict.
That is why I reaffirm yet again, from this highest world rostrum, Ukraine’s firm commitment to multilateralism and international law.
The Kremlin’s aggression towards us had an absolutely opposite effect.
Instead of submitting to Russia, we have defied them.
Instead of giving up our European dream, we have accelerated our path towards it.
Instead of bowing down our heads, we have raised them high saying to Putin: “You will not break us down!”.
I urge Russia as party to the conflict to honor its own obligations under the Minsk arrangements.
I ask this house to support us, to stand with us and deny the Kremlin’s imperial ambitions.
Only together we can force Russia - an occupying power and aggressor - to accept its responsibility and cease with its aggressive actions.
And we believe that the United Nations has an important role to play in countering the aggression.
Limiting United Nations’ engagement to humanitarian action or human rights monitoring in Ukraine is not enough.
We felt hopeful when in 2018 Secretary-General Antonio Guterres listed the issue of resolving the Russian-Ukrainian conflict among his priorities.
Regrettably, not much progress has been made.
Yet it has to be made. It must.
For Reshat Ametov, for Volodymyr Rybak, for Yuriy Popravko.
For thousands other victims of this cruel, ugly, unnecessary war.
For the civilians. For the soldiers. For the families.
For those who never came back.
For those who spend sleepless nights crying for them.
For the world. For the peace, For the honor of this mankind.
Thank you."

President’s speech at a special session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the Russian armed aggression against Ukraine
",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vistup-prezidenta-pid-chas-specialnogo-zasidannya-verhovnoyi-53254,19 February 2019  - 14:04,"Dear great friend of Ukraine, Mr. Donald Tusk!
Dear Mr. Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada!
Dear Mr. Prime Minister!
Dear members of the Ukrainian Government!
Dear people's deputies!
Dear friends of ours who have been standing side by side with Ukraine for five years while protecting global security, sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine!
Dear military - the elite of the nation, who are present in this hall!
Fellow Ukrainians!
A burning Maidan. The first casualties. Expectation of a new assault. Exactly five years ago, on February 19, after the 18th - after the tragedy right here on the Square of the Constitution, the first people were shot in the Mariyinsky Park, and on February 19, none of us knew what would happen tomorrow. But all, I emphasize - all who were on Maidan, were ready to stand until the end. And ""tomorrow"", on February 20, a mass shooting of the Heavenly Hundred took place. And tomorrow, on February 20, Russian aggression began.
And it was precisely this date that the Kremlin scratched on medals distributed to the Russian invaders and collaborators who seized Crimea.
The murder of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred was the beginning of a bloody war that Russia has unleashed against Ukraine. Why was it done? Today everyone clearly understands - for the restoration of the empire, for the revision of the borders and, in the end, for the destruction of the whole system of transatlantic security in Europe and the world. For the destruction of the post-war security system based on the United Nations Security Council and the unity of all five permanent members of the Security Council. It cannot work when one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council is an aggressor country. And the collective security system was destroyed. The annexation of Crimea, the occupation of the Donbas part became the prelude to the hybrid war of Moscow not only against Ukraine. Today, Mr. President (President of the European Council Donald Tusk - ed.) has rightly pointed out - the hybrid war of Moscow against the European Union, including Poland; against the United States, against NATO, against the Baltic States and, in the end, against the whole democratic and civilized world.
I want to emphasize separately that by defending Ukraine, the Heroes of Maidan, Ukrainian soldiers, all patriots defend the eastern borders of Europe from the invasion which threatens the destruction of freedom, the destruction of democracy, the destruction of the rule of law and the destruction, in the end, of respect for human dignity. And this war was unleashed by Moscow because here, in Kyiv, on the European Maidan Nezalezhnosti, Moscow has lost its civilizational battle for Ukraine. The blitzkrieg, which Moscow was counting on, failed. Those plans to split and tear apart, to destroy our state did not succeed. But I want to remind and emphasize - a very high price was paid for this.
And now Putin clearly understands that the loss of Ukraine means the collapse of his plans to restore the empire and to return Russia the status of a superpower. They cannot do it economically, because their economy goes well beyond effective countries.
Therefore, the rates in this war are super high now. I emphasize - not only Ukraine. Putin's dream -  is not a divided Ukraine anymore, but a divided Europe. Putin's dream is Europe that has abandoned its values. Putin's dream is a weakened Europe, to which he dictates conditions. Putin's dream is a belt of dependent satellites, whose sovereignty is purely nominal. And the examples of these countries are very well known to us.
And beyond doubt, I want to say firmly: the Kremlin is doomed to defeat in this war. I emphasize that in five years it failed to achieve any of the goals set for Ukraine, and tactically, friends, we have already won! When will we achieve a strategic and final victory? The answer to this question depends on our unity.
We must read and study the lessons of a century-old past of 1918-1921.
The victory in this war depends on our resolve, as well as on the unity and determination of our international coalition, which was created by us in support of Ukraine with the help of our friends. I want to emphasize that the prominent role here belongs to President of the European Council Donald Tusk. Remember his words from this rostrum - there can be no safe and democratic Europe without Ukraine. These are the words of the leader of the European Union to the skeptics, some of whom are sitting in this hall, while some are saying on TV that Ukraine will never be admitted to the EU, will never be a member of NATO. My friends, I emphasize - it will be admitted.
Although nobody has paid such a high price for the European and Euro-Atlantic choice as Ukraine did. Unfortunately, it is true. Nobody has ever paid such great sacrifices for this choice. And we must always remember the irredeemable debt to our heroes. And this debt prompts us to do everything for their struggle not to be useless, so that nobody and nothing can bring us back to the chains of Moscow. The phrase is very popular now that the rubicon has been crossed - I emphasize that it will never be crossed. We must always fight for our civilized choice, for the return of Ukraine to the family of European nations. Just as Ukrainians have been struggling to remove the Moscow yoke from the Ukrainian church for 300 years, we must be ready for 300 years to prevent the return of the status of Ukraine as a colony of the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union. We will never allow it.
The days of the anniversary of the shooting on Maidan, everyone understands that, are psychologically very difficult for each of us. For me personally these are days of bitter memories and painful experiences. These are the days of in-depth self-criticism and thorough analysis of the work done and not done. These are days of a meaningful work on mistakes and thorough contemplation of further steps.
Of course, there are a lot of complaints that I accept. And I admit that too much mistakes were done. But the fact is after five difficult years, our government has not stepped back from the European and Euro-Atlantic strategy. We were consistent and nobody could turn us away from the chosen path.
The elements of our path, our strategy are the Association Agreement with the EU, including the free trade area. The elements of our strategy are the visa-free regime. The elements of the strategy are transformation of the European Union into the most powerful trading partner who helped us, having opened the door and extending a helping hand, survive the consequences of Russia's economic blockade and the crisis caused by it. The elements of this strategy are the gradual switch of the whole defense-security bloc to the NATO standards. In 2014, the work in the defense and security sector was not even started. The law prohibited NATO members from entering, opening the doors of the General Staff or the Ministry of Defense. And you, people's deputies in this hall, remember that one of the first initiatives in June-July was the abolition of this nonsense in our legislation.
Before joining the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance, we still have - and we all clearly understand that - to cover a long path: overcome poverty, meet membership criteria, make our difficult homework. But I emphasize that today we have achieved an unprecedented rapprochement with Europe in our history. The President of the European Council has never delivered a speech in Ukrainian. Donald, Ukrainian language with European optimism lacked by some of our deputies. Not only political, not only economic, but also cultural and humanitarian union. Aviation and railway routes, including low cost airlines, tourist flows, geography of educational institutions where young people get knowledge - all this testifies to the tectonic scale of change, the complete reorientation of the country from Russia to the European Union.
Against this backdrop, amendments to the Constitution obliging the authorities to do their utmost to achieve Ukraine's membership in the European Union and NATO are a completely logical interim conclusion of what we have done in five years. However, I emphasize that this is also a guarantee, insurance for the future. I had no doubt about its necessity before, but with the beginning of the election campaign its rightness became obvious.
I have taken the effort to get acquainted with the candidates' programs. Surprisingly, most of them do not have a point on membership in NATO, membership in the European Union. Someone must have crossed them out.
Another program offers the referendum to decide on the issue of membership in NATO or other security associations. The authors are not aware that there is no ""other security association"" near our borders. It is the one - and the name of this association, if someone does not know, is NATO. The Collective Security Treaty Organization controlled by the Russian General Staff... Can they mean it? What are ""other security associations""? We will not allow that.
Of course, there is also the fifth column, which, at the Kremlin’s dictation, has again exposed to the light the notorious non-alignment program, which has already costed us Crimea and parts of Donbas. I want to remind you - the aggression began when Ukraine had a non-aligned status. And the worst thing is that it costed us thousands and thousands of human lives. 2949 soldiers gave their lives for us to have a chance to change the state. And we will not waste this chance.
So, we see that the amendments to the Constitution, which give our European and Euro-Atlantic integration the force of the Basic Law, are definitely not superfluous.
There are, however, those who want to change the whole Constitution in an anti-constitutional way, bypassing the Verkhovna Rada. And there is also no place for NATO and the European Union in their concept. But I am convinced that protective mechanisms of democracy have already been formed and will work effectively in Ukraine, ruining this attempt.
I believe my strategic mission is to ensure the irreversibility of European and Euro-Atlantic integration. To apply for membership in the European Union and receive a NATO Membership Action Plan by 2023. This is our common task.
In carrying out this mission, I swear to adhere to the Constitution of Ukraine, including its new provisions, which I propose to sign right here.
Today, we are not going to look back at Russia. We will not ask Putin where we should go. We are going our way. We make our own decision on how to ensure our own security, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Ten years ago, due to the lack of a single line of the President, Parliament, Government, Ukraine has lost an opportunity to get the MAP. Today, I emphasize this separately, the position of the Head of State, the position of the Cabinet of Ministers, the position of the leadership of the Parliament and the Parliament of Ukraine is unanimous. I am grateful to all of you for this.
This is evidenced by 334 votes - the convincing majority - for constitutional changes. Availing myself of this opportunity, I would like to express once again my sincere gratitude to the people's deputies.
I would like to invite Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Andriy Parubiy and Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman in the presence of the President of the European Council - one of the leaders of the European Union, a friend of Ukraine Donald Tusk to certify the unity of all branches of power in the matter of European and Euro-Atlantic integration.
Thank you!

President's speech in the Verkhovna Rada on the consolidation of the strategic course of the state on gaining full-fledged membership of Ukraine in the European Union and NATO in the Constitution
",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vistup-prezidenta-u-parlamenti-shodo-zakriplennya-u-konstitu-52978,7 February 2019  - 12:09,"Honorable Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine!
Dear Mr. Prime Minister!
Dear people’s deputies!
Dear members of the Ukrainian Government!
Dear Ukrainian nation, fellow Ukrainians!
Today is a historic day. Iryna Stepanivno, today it may happen that your birthday will coincide with a unique, fateful voting in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, when the movement of Ukraine to the European Union, Ukraine's movement to the North Atlantic Alliance will be consolidated in the Constitution as a foreign political landmark.
Yesterday in Brussels, North Macedonia received a protocol of accession to the North Atlantic Alliance. There will be 30 such members of the Alliance. North Macedonia's path was extremely difficult, but the country demonstrated unity, ruined the plans of Russia that tried to stop this extremely important move to security, strengthening of European security, and the doors of NATO have become open to the 30th country.
Yesterday, the European Commission decided to start negotiations on the membership of North Macedonia in the European Union - and this is another demonstration of how these processes are interrelated: NATO and the EU.
It is very important that NATO is about security. Not only military security, not only a fundamental change in the geopolitical map of the world. This is also about security of a citizen - security on the streets, protection of the constitutional rights and freedoms of a citizen, the rule of law. And this is what unites us today with regard to changes in legislation and reforms in our beloved Ukraine.
I emphasize that this is also related to the accession to the EU, Ukraine's compliance with the criteria necessary for membership. And this also includes protection of the living standards of a Ukrainian citizen. Reforms mean protecting people.
Of course, 9-10 years ago, calls for multiple vectors were heard  in this hall, irresponsible calls for non-alignment. I want to remind everyone that in February 2014 Russian aggression began when Russia attacked Ukraine, which had a non-aligned status. It didn’t save us from anything.

And now we have to move forward resolutely, along the road to membership in the EU and NATO. A great friend of Ukraine and a great friend of mine Jens Stoltenberg said this week that NATO's doors are open to any country that is capable of reforming and ensuring the fulfillment of the goals of the Washington Treaty.
This is exactly about Ukraine. For the past five years, we have been doing that.
We are reforming the defense and security sector. We are reforming the army. And the role of the Verkhovna Rada in this process is difficult to overestimate.
And when it was difficult, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine rejected the political confrontation and united. And it is unity that Ukraine needs today, it is unity that is needed during our historic voting. I am convinced that this unity will be demonstrated.
I want to emphasize that now, right now during the live broadcast, developments in the Verkhovna Rada are very closely monitored in the Kremlin.

Dream on! You will not rejoice today. And the Verkhovna Rada today will demonstrate the unity that has been demonstrated over the last four years. Millions of Ukrainians are also watching the course of our vote in the Verkhovna Rada on TV. I am convinced, friends, you will have pleasant news today.
I am confident that we will continue our joint efforts to reform Ukraine. I am confident that the tasks of membership in the European Union and NATO are absolutely real.
Just as we have demonstrated the achievement of other goals that few people have believed, our joint efforts will ensure Ukraine's membership in NATO, membership in the EU. We are going our way and this is the way to Ukraine's membership in the EU and NATO.
Thank you. I call for unity.
Glory to Ukraine!"

Address  of President of Ukraine  at the Traditional meeting with heads of diplomatic representation of foreign states and international organizations accredited in Ukraine  
",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vistup-prezidenta-na-shorichnij-zustrichi-z-glavami-diplomat-52522,16 January 2019  - 21:35,"Your Excellences,
Dear Mr. Speaker, Mr. Prime Minister,
Your Beatitude, 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear friends,
Please accept my sincere congratulations on the New Year!
May this year bring us what all people on our planet strive for the most, and what we, Ukrainians, pray for five years already – peace.
Only those who have experienced the war understand the true value of peace.
However, peace is not only about the absence of war.
Peace is about freedom. It is about being a master on your own land.
It is also about the right to freely choose and determine your own future.
That is why for us peace and freedom are undivided.
For us, Ukrainians, these values are not abstract, but very special ones.
We know for sure what we fight for.
This is where our strength resides. Contrary to those who want to deprive us from our freedom and peace.
 
Your Excellencies,
The future of the world order is being shaped in front of our very eyes.
And it is Ukraine that happened to be on the cutting edge of clash of civilizations, at the forefront of protecting our common values, the struggle between good and evil.
Only by restoring Ukraine’s territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, we will revive the confidence in the rule of international law.
Only by ending Russian aggression, we will save the world from a Kremlin-grown virus of revanchism and neo-imperialism.
I want the world to know about it.
I want the world to hear that on the 1st of January, when everyone celebrated the fest of New Year, we lost a Ukrainian soldier – Mykola Golubev, who was killed by Russian aggressors shelling in Donbas.
In December 2018, he just turned 20.
His whole life was still ahead. But, it was taken by the Russian aggressor who broke into Ukrainian land.
I tell you about this because so is the present day in Ukraine.
This is what my every day is all about, as the President of Ukraine and as Commander-in-Chief, for already four and a half years.
This is what my heart bleeds about every given day, and this is what I would never be able to accept.
That is why I ask you on the following: when you inform your capitals, no matter how your governments vote for Ukraine-related resolutions in international organizations, please deliver truth about the undeclared war waged by Russia against Ukraine.
About Ukraine’s sacrifice as we defend peace in Europe.
About that the Kremlin does not plan to stop on Ukraine.
That in Ukraine Russia fine-tunes its new technologies of hybrid war. And it is only a matter of time where the Kremlin will use them tomorrow, the very next days.
Moscow understands well the strategic importance of Ukraine for the realization of its imperialistic fantasies.
The design is simple – that Ukraine will fall, that Ukraine will not stand.  
If Ukraine falls, it would only incite Russian appetites in other parts of Europe and in other parts of the world.
The methods of Russian aggression may change. The only thing remains unchanged – it lacks strive for peace.
For over four years, the Kremlin has refused implementing its obligations under the Minsk arrangements, which it signed itself.
The latest ceasefire – actually the 18th – has been violated yet again by the Russian side.
The Kremlin continues holding Ukrainian hostages in its prisons both in Russia and on the occupied Ukrainian territories.
Among them are the 24 Ukrainian sailors – prisoners of war. No mockery trial would help Russia hide its act of open aggression against Ukraine in the neutral waters of the Black sea.
Among them are Sakharov Prize laureate Oleg Sentsov, and Ukrainian patriot Volodymyr Baluch, who raised Ukraine’s flag over his house in the occupied Crimea.
Among them are the Crimean Tatars – sons and daughters of the people that suffers from a second genocide and a second deportation due to the Russian occupation.  
At the same time, the Kremlin understands that the Ukrainian army has become much stronger over last years.
It realizes that any attempt of further military invasion would end close to disastrous for aggressor.
Therefore, the Kremlin bets on undermining Ukraine from within.
The year 2019 will be decisive from this standpoint. The Kremlin has been preparing itself for it for long and at length.   
There is no secret about Moscow plans. The Russian leadership does not bother itself much with masking its intentions – to bring to office the authorities to be under its control as results of the presidential and parliamentary elections this year.
The aim is also quite clear – to stop democratic developments in Ukraine, its progress along the way of the European and the Euro-Atlantic integration, and to bring it back to the so-called “Russian sphere of influence”.
This is not just our take.
The Russian meddling to influence Ukraine’s elections is well under way. 
That said I would like to assure you that, as the President, I will do my utmost, first of all, to minimize the Russian influence on our elections.
And secondly – to create all conditions necessary for free and fair elections in Ukraine in line with the highest international standards. 
To that end, we have invited observers of reputable international organizations and countries to monitor the presidential elections.
 
Dear friends,
Not only the Kremlin was preparing itself for the year 2019.  
In Ukraine, we were preparing ourselves as well for this special year.
Despite the war ongoing, we launched and successfully implement the reforms – the most ambitious and most comprehensive ones in our history. 
We reached a significant progress, which was recognized by you, in modernizing our economy and infrastructure. 
We launched large-scale reforms in budget sphere, privatization, education, health care, pension system, decentralization and many others. 
We gave the first decisive fight to an epidemic corruption in Ukraine – we have set a reliable front of independent anti-corruption agencies, including the High Anti-corruption Court.  
We cleaned up a stall of corrupt practices in energy sector and in public procurement. 
We restrained inflation, reduced budget deficit and ensured sustainable macro financial stability. 
We have taken track of economic growth on a strong note. The digital economy has been launched. With confidence, we look forward to arrival of heavyweight foreign investors in Ukraine.    
There is no doubt that without support of our partners, especially of G7, it would be impossible to achieve all these in such a short period. 
I tender my sincere gratitude to you, in particular to the Presidency, for supporting Ukraine.
By standing by Ukraine, you have taken over a great responsibility – to help Ukraine escape from a former Soviet trap and now of “russkyi mir” and to turn our state into a land of freedom and prosperity. 
It is with confidence that we are going our own way. 
The way of building a democratic, based on the rule of law, European state, which is heading to EU and NATO membership consistently. 
This is the way of our national consensus, of our national idea. 
I am confident that we will not step back from this path any more.  
The deep and comprehensive free trade area with the EU is our guide for the full-fledged economic integration into the single European market.  
Ukraine successfully implements fundamental changes in security and defence sector. 
Ukrainian army already ranks among the top 10 of the most powerful armies of Europe. 
A recently adopted Law on National Security will be bringing us closer to the NATO standards at a faster pace. 
Moreover, our future membership in EU and NATO will be fixed in the Constitution.  
I believe that this my initiative will be supported shortly by the Ukrainian Parliament in the second reading. 
It will be our additional safeguard against any attempt of revanche.  
I would like to convey the words of my special gratitude to the United States – to our strategic partners. In Ukraine, we greatly value the transatlantic leadership of Washington as regards the countering of Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine.
It will not be an exaggeration to say that the decision to grant Ukraine with Javelins was historic one.
As deterrent, it considerably strengthened the security of our state.
It has also provided a long-awaited message to our partners.
Last year gave no chance to the Russian aggression to jump off the hook of sanctions, which, despite the Kremlin’s bravado, painfully hit at its ambitions and appetites.
Not only did they weaken the machinery of Russian aggression. They did give Ukraine a precious time to grow stronger – politically, economically, and militarily.
It was assisted by our close coordination with Berlin and Paris – reliable partners of Ukraine in the Normandy format.
The words of my most special gratitude go to Chancellor Angela Merkel.
It would be hard to overestimate what she has done to avoid catastrophic scenarios, both for Ukraine and Europe.
Unity and solidarity of the world behind Ukraine in response to Azov attack of Russia became like a cold shower for Moscow.
I am grateful to all those who supported us in this difficult moment. Especially to those states, which became co-sponsors and supported the two important resolutions of the UN General Assembly – on human rights in the Crimea and on militarization of the Crimea and parts of the Black and Azov Seas.
Your position has yet again confirmed that the Kremlin will pay a high price for its aggression.
The day will come when this price will go too heavy for the Kremlin.
Then we will return both the temporary occupied Crimea and the occupied part of Donbas.
It will definitely come true, which is confirmed by Ukraine’s way to the restoration of historic justice – establishment of autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine. And almost all of you congratulated Ukrainian people with this great event.
Our road to Tomos was lengthy, uneasy and thorny. But we covered it with dignity.
Deeply and wholeheartedly I express my gratitude to all those involved in this difficult process – both from religious to secular authorities.
It is only with time that one would understand a historic scale of this event.
This is the second act of Ukraine’s independence, of our spiritual independence.
 
Your Excellencies,
The coming year will be decisive not only for Ukraine.
Unfortunately, a number of “hot spots” on the planet is growing.
It is not by coincidence that the major part of them is located inside or near Europe.
It is hard to miss the looming shadow of the same author of the chain of events, aimed at undermining the unity of the European Union.
It is crystal clear that this author is trying to relaunch the well-prepared in advance or to create new conflicts along the whole EU perimeter – starting from Ukraine and Moldova, Southern Caucasus, Western Balkans, Middle East, Africa up to directly some EU member states.
And this author is sitting in the Kremlin.
Therefore, it is of utmost importance for all of us to understand that and to stop considering all the current challenges as separate cases.
The world and its security are interlinked as never before.
That is why all what is going on in Ukraine today does matter for the countries, which are thousands miles away. And vice versa.
That is why by strengthening Ukraine’s resilience you, our partners, are investing in your own security, in your own peaceful future.
I believe that those, who are challenging the current world order, are powerless against our unity and solidarity.
They are our strength and guarantee of victory.
I would like to thank all of you for your very important support to Ukraine.
I am grateful that you share with us both the days of happiness and sorrow. Grateful that you are with us in times of successes and losses.
On my behalf, I wish all countries that you represent peace, welfare and prosperity.
And I want to finish with a new greeting in Ukraine.
Glory to Ukraine!"

President’s address on the occasion of granting the Tomos of autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine
",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/promova-prezidenta-z-nagodi-vruchennya-tomosu-pro-avtokefali-52378,6 January 2019  - 11:11,"A great historic event, in which the Lord was with us, with Ukrainians, has just finished. And we, Ukrainians, were with the Lord. The Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine has finally received the Tomos from the Ecumenical Patriarch, from the Mother Church.
The Lord saw and commended the persistent struggle of the Ukrainian people for their independence. He heard our prayers. He gave us proper reparation for our work and facilitated that His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and the Synod of the Constantinople Mother Church said the long-awaited ""yes"" to the independent Church of Ukraine.
Today's event in the history of our country will remain in line with St. Vladimir’s baptism and the proclamation of Ukraine's independence. The Orthodox world will remember the day when the Church of Ukraine possessing equal rights joined the family of sister churches.
Our country has covered a long path to this day. And no wonder that yesterday His All-Holiness recalled in his speech Olga - our first Christian Princess and Equal of the Apostles Prince Vladimir-Baptist. And long before them, the holy Apostle Andrew stood on the mountains of Kyiv and ""his eyes saw Ukraine, and the mouth - blessed. And he planted the seed of faith in us"". This, by the way, is a quotation from the decisions of our Orthodox Council of 1621.
For over a thousand years, Kyiv's Christian tradition has been respected and multiplied. Today, our Orthodox Church is ready for independent existence. The Ukrainian people thank God and what has happened is a true miracle, which we owe to the Creator's will.
We rejoice that the Ecumenical Patriarch, as the spiritual leader of hundreds of millions of Orthodox people, as a global figure heard our voice and our requests. And the tireless work of His All-Holiness on the spiritual field will forever remain in the history of the church and in the history of nations, especially the Orthodox.
And the Tomos for us is actually another act of proclaiming Ukraine's independence. It will complete the assertion of the independence of the Ukrainian state, strengthen religious freedom, interconfessional peace. It will strengthen the rights and freedoms of citizens, especially those who were outside the communion with the Ecumenical Orthodoxy and who were unjustly called non-canonical.
His All-Holiness these days especially emphasizes the importance of restoring the communication of millions and millions of Ukrainian believers with the fullness of the world Orthodoxy. In addition, for Ukrainians, our own Church is a guarantee of our spiritual freedom. This is the key to social harmony.
And as President, I guarantee on behalf of the state that Ukraine will respect the religious choices and freedom of religion of every citizen.
I congratulate all those who care about the rise of the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine. And I thank everyone who tirelessly worked on its emergence, created unity and restored justice!
St. Sophia, the wisdom of God was with us and we fulfilled our duty to the past and to the next generations.
Glory to God!
Glory to Ukraine!"

President’s New Year Address
",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/novorichne-privitannya-prezidenta-ukrayini-52350,31 December 2018  - 23:54,"Fellow Ukrainians!
A moment later and the chronicle of the year 2018 will be left in the archive of the Ukrainian history. It has a special place there. Near 1991, when our state independence was declared.
On December 15 here, on St. Sophia, the Unity Council was held. Thousands of people convened on the square and were not ashamed of tears. And those were tears of joy. At last, the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine recognized by the world Orthodoxy was born.
The struggle for the independence of our church lasted for hundreds of years it is only now that we have succeeded.
This is a true miracle!
It is a sign of God that we, Ukrainians, will all be fine.
Shortly, along with the good news of the birth of the Savior, Ukraine will receive the long-awaited Tomos - a charter from the Ecumenical Patriarchate. It will document our spiritual independence.
We have become further from Moscow and closer to Europe. This is a clear strategy that has been steadfastly followed over the past five years. We go our own way. Neither promises of manna from heaven, nor grain of despondency, nor potion of discord - nothing should turn us back.
""The power of the people lies in the unity, God, give us the unity,"" - I would like these words to become the motto of the next year for the authorities, society and every citizen. Especially since the year 2019 is the 100th anniversary of the Zluky Act, the centennial of our unity.
We do not want anything more than peace. And no one wants peace more than we do. So, on behalf of you, let me congratulate, first of all, Ukrainian soldiers. They guarantee us peace and quiet on this New Year's Eve.
Let the seamen captured by Russians also feel our gratitude and the warmth of our hearts. And wounded among them - Andriy Eyder, Vasyl Soroka, Andriy Artemenko. And Ukrainian political prisoners in Russian prisons. And our citizens who became hostages in the temporarily occupied territories.
I appeal to millions of Ukrainians in Crimea and on the other side of Donbas. We will definitely return to you with peace, no matter how long it may take. Our family will surely reunite at one table, at which the New Year is met by Kyiv time.

Fellow Ukrainians!
The hardest thing has already passed, and the worst is also behind. The gradual growth of the economy and the restoration of living standards are ahead. This is the result of our common, hard work.
The main thing is not to trample the sprouts of development, gained at the cost of great sacrifices and enormous efforts of each of you, in the electoral race. Then we will surely win.

I wish you all happy New Year!
May our destiny stand with us!
Glory to Ukraine!"

I congratulate everyone on the creation of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, which has just happened in St. Sophia!
Your Eminence!
Your Eminence - distinguished representatives of His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew!
Your Holiness!
Your Beatitude!
Fellow Ukrainians!
Dear and distinguished community convened on St. Sophia’s Square, witnessing the most important lines of the chronicle of Ukraine!
Such a great event is happening today.
People say it is very cold in the streets. But each of you over several hours of tense expectation was warmed by your heart and thrill of anticipation of a great epochal event.
Dear friends, you are not witnesses. You are the creators of history, which is now happening. You are the direct participants of this great sacrament, which has just happened inside the St. Sophia’s Cathedral. The Cathedral that Yaroslav the Wise, the son of the Equal-to-apostles Prince Volodymyr the Baptist, built a thousand years ago in honor of the victory over the eastern horde. That is why your presence here, your mass support was extremely important for all the members of the Council. Frankly, I felt it, being among delegates at the invitation of His All-Holiness Patriarch Bartholomew.
So, it's done!
Today is December 15. I ask everyone who is watching us now: in Ukraine, all over the world - remember very well. This day will enter or has already entered the history of Ukraine as a sacred day, the day of the creation of the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine. The day of the final gaining of Ukrainian independence from Russia. And Ukraine will no longer drink, as Taras Shevchenko said, ""Moscow’s poison from the Moscow’s bowl"".
This is the day of the creation of the Church recognized by the world Orthodoxy as an independent structure - just as in the vast majority of countries belonging to the Orthodox Christian tradition.
All representatives, the autocephalous council of the UOC-Kyivan Patriarchate, the cathedral and all the hierarchs of the UAOC, a group of bishops of the UOC-Moscow Patriarchate have just founded the united Church.
This miracle came true due to the steadfast position of His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, our Constantinople Mother Church. It took advantage of the unconditional canonical right to heal the wounds inflicted on the Ukrainian Orthodoxy by several centuries of Moscow’ domination.
Our talks were long-lasting. But over this year His All-Holiness and the Synod decided step by step to provide autocephaly. This is the first. Second, they approved the draft of the Tomos, certificate of independence. Third, they lifted all the unjust Moscow penalties from Ukrainian bishops, which got out of control of the Russian Orthodox Church at the dawn of independence and began to build structures of an independent church. And fourth, they confirmed the illegality of the annexation of the Kyivan Metropolitanate by Moscow, which was carried out in the XVII century. They, like us, do not recognize any claims of the ROC to Ukraine.
Therefore, as a result of the decisions of the Mother Church, the firm political will of secular authorities, the President, the Parliament, which supported the President's appeal, and most importantly of the Ukrainian people, due to the responsible position of the hierarchs of the three Orthodox jurisdictions today, a new united and independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church was born.
What is this church? This is a church without Putin. What is this church? This is a church without Kirill. What is this church? This is a church without prayer for the Russian authorities and Russian army. Because the Russian authorities and Russian army kill Ukrainians. But this is a church with God. This church is with Ukraine.
Yesterday, in social networks, I read a very interesting opinion: ""The church does not only sing and pray. The Church raises a true Ukrainian citizen"". And then I recalled the phrase traditionally attributed to Otto von Bismarck: ""Generals do not win the wars. The wars are won by school teachers and priests"". Of course, it should not be understood literally. It is about the unique role of the clergy and teachers in the formation of the nation and in the process of state building.
We are now creating an independent Ukraine. And this event is as important as the referendum on our independence adopted more than 27 years ago.
And what kind of citizen will be raised by the church center, if it is located in a foreign state, moreover, in the aggressor country? Exactly not a citizen of Ukraine. The Kremlin does not hide the fact that it considers the Russian Orthodox Church as one of the main instruments of influence on Ukraine. The situation in the Ukrainian Orthodoxy is discussed at the Russian Security Council under the chairmanship of its president. Instead, the Ukrainian state is required not to interfere in its own Ukrainian affairs!
And when Moscow speaks about Ukraine as allegedly its canonical territory, isn’t it an encroachment on our territorial integrity? And aren’t we obliged to protect Ukrainian soil and Ukrainian spirit in such conditions?
And we know well: in the areas where the Russian censer is being waved today, Russian missiles will strike tomorrow. At first, Patriarch Kirill toured Ukraine with the propaganda of the ""Russian peace"" and a single font, and then their tanks came! Obviously, the issue of autocephaly goes far beyond the church's fence. This is an issue of our national security. This is an issue of our statehood. This is an issue of the world politics. It is not a surprise that all the state leaders with whom I met over the past 6 months asked me: ""What about your church?"". We enjoy a huge and important support in this issue all over the world.
And when the Russian president said that the collapse of the USSR became for Russia the main geopolitical disaster of the XX century. ""For Putin,"" as Myroslav Marynovych wrote very well, ""The provision of autocephaly to Ukrainian Orthodoxy is the second geopolitical disaster"". But let me correct it, this time - the scale is not of the century, but of the millennium. Let them know that.
Fellow Ukrainians!
We have once again proved that nothing is impossible for us. A few years ago, many people said that it is impossible even if Poroshenko is involved, even if we do everything. Possible. There is nothing impossible for us. The main thing is to believe in the big purpose and not to retreat from it. Following this principle we have got the Association Agreement. Following this principle we have got the visa-free regime. Following this principle we are moving further towards the EU. And it is extremely important for us that all the victories will be with Ukraine. I want to emphasize separately that today we have a great day. We will not retreat from the path we are following starting from 2014.
Today is a common holiday of the Orthodox, Greek Catholics, Roman Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims. In short, for all who value the freedom of Ukraine. Who value our independence. No patriot doubts the importance of having an independent Orthodox church in an independent Ukrainian state. Such a church is a spiritual guarantor of our sovereignty. In December 1991, at the referendum, we approved the Declaration of Independence. In December 2018, an independent Orthodox Ukrainian Church was founded, to which the Ecumenical Patriarch will hand over the Tomos.
Autocephaly is part of our state pro-European and pro-Ukrainian strategy, which we have been consistently implementing for almost five years. All this is the basis of our own way of development, development of the state of Ukraine and development of our Ukrainian nation.
""Russian comrade, don't mess with Ukraine!"" - I quoted Mayakovsky in August 2016 at the parade on the 25th anniversary of Independence. And our Armed Forces are getting stronger every day. And it's not a joke!
“Farewell, unwashed Russia” - I said on the European Square when we gained the visa-free regime, I quoted Lermontov. Farewell indeed!
“Farewell to you, our tender Misha, go back home to your wood of fairy tales” - these words were addressed to Moscow in autumn this year. Farewell indeed!
“Away from Moscow! Europe now!”. Now these winged phrases of the Ukrainian writer of the beginning of the last century Mykola Khvylovy became part of our political dictionary. And they precisely convey the essence of our state strategy, our confident course towards the European Union and NATO.
Fellow community!
Allow me from all of our community, from the entire Ukraine and the Ukrainian people to express gratitude to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew for his incredible care for Ukraine.
I want to thank all Ukrainians who believed in the autocephaly from the outset, who supported the President, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, the Parliament, supported our hierarchs and fought for the autocephaly even when the very idea seemed illusory.
First of all, I also want to thank our hierarchs and leaders of our Orthodox churches. His Holiness Filaret. Your Holiness, do you hear this reaction of people on the square? ... Your Holiness, the extent, which can measure the contribution of Patriarch Filaret to the struggle for our own Autocephalous Church has not been invented yet. You were, are and remain the spiritual leader of the Ukrainian church, the spiritual leader of the Ukrainian people.
I want to thank Primate of the UAOC Metropolitan Macarius and the whole episcopate for a firm position and an extraordinary role in this historical process.
I want to thank the hierarchs of the UOC-Moscow Patriarchate, who, despite the pressure, threats and curses of Moscow and its fifth column, made a courageous decision and came to the Council today. Everything is very simple - they chose Ukraine between Ukraine and Russia. And we commend this choice.
We did not have, do not have and will not have a state church. The state will not interfere in church affairs. And nobody will ""invite"" anyone by force to the Orthodox Church consecrated by the Tomos. Once again, I emphasize that this is an issue of free choice for each believer. I guarantee that the authorities will respect the choice of those who, under certain circumstances, decide to remain in the church structure, which will maintain unity with the ROC. But I also guarantee that the state will protect the rights of the priests and believers of the UOC-Moscow Patriarchate, who voluntarily decide to leave Moscow in order to create, together with other Orthodox, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church.
Such Church has been founded today. It needs some time for its development, peaceful expansion and strengthening. Let me now introduce you the newly elected Primate, Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine Epifaniy. It will be his honorable mission to go to Constantinople with the Ukrainian President in early January and get the long-awaited Tomos. Bishop Epifaniy, representative of the younger generation of bishops, was nominated by the UOC-Kyivan Patriarchate and supported by the representatives of other churches. But now there is no such division. That division does not matter anymore, because a united church is being created.
The power of our people is in unity. God, give us the unity! There is such a prayer and it is very relevant to today's events.
Unity is what will give us victory.
Fellow Ukrainians!
I sincerely congratulate you on the autocephaly and the achievement of our spiritual independence.
We have stopped the aggressor. We have saved the state. We have built a capable army. We affirm the Ukrainian language as a component of the strength and success of our people.
Over this year, we have become even more convinced that the Autocephalous Church is the key to independence. The state language is the key to unity. A strong army is the key to peace.
We will certainly win!
Glory to God and Glory to Ukraine!
And now, with pleasure, I give the floor to the Primate of the united Church, Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine Epifaniy. Please, Bishop!"

Statement by the President of Ukraine on the approval of the Decree on the introduction of martial law in Ukraine
",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zayava-prezidenta-ukrayini-shodo-zatverdzhennya-ukazu-pro-vv-51362,26 November 2018  - 17:33,"Fellow Ukrainians!
Today, the Parliament will consider the issue of extreme importance, which directly concerns your protection, your security, the security of Ukraine, its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
According to the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine adopted tonight, as President and as Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I have fulfilled my constitutional duty and a few hours ago, by my decree, I introduced martial law all over Ukraine starting from 9 am, November 28 .
Russia has been waging a hybrid war against our country for five years. But with an attack on Ukrainian military boats it moved to a new stage of aggression. No one will say now: ""They are not there"". No one camouflages into green humanoids or militiamen. This is a bold and frank participation of the regular units of the Russian Federation, their demonstrative attack on the detachment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This is a qualitatively different situation, a qualitatively different threat.
And this attack, of course, is not accidental. This is clearly an element planned by Russians in the escalation of the situation in the waters of the Sea of Azov, which has been lasting for several months. And I'm sure this is still not a culmination.
Security officials and diplomats have informed you today at a press conference about all the circumstances of yesterday's incident.
Reconnaissance data suggest an extremely serious threat of a land-based operation against Ukraine. I have a document of intelligence in my hands, a summary of our intelligence data. Here on several pages is a detailed description of all the forces of the enemy located at a distance of literally several dozens of kilometers from our border. Ready at any moment for an immediate invasion of Ukraine. A rifle hanging on the wall will go off sooner or later. And these are planes, helicopters, tanks, missile complexes, armored personnel carriers, salvo fire systems.
Of all the options provided by the Law ""On the Legal Status of Martial Law"", the Decree, my Decree ""On the Imposition of Martial Law"" includes only those that deal mainly with various military activities - we must strengthen the security right now. (Measures - ed.) that in case of the invasion will allow us to react as quickly as possible, mobilize all resources as soon as possible. Especially since the boys and girls from the first wave of the reserve, which already have military experience, are ready to pack rucksacks right now and resources will be mobilized - both human, arms and financial.
I emphasize that I do not envisage any measures in the Decree related to the restriction of the rights and freedoms of citizens, introduction of censorship, etc. I hope that both politicians and mass media will act responsibly and adequately in the current situation and will not attack Ukraine with the theses borrowed from Russian propagandists.
Nor do I plan to resort to full or partial mobilization so far - this opportunity remains open only if Russia resorts to further escalation.
Martial law does not mean the declaration of war. It is introduced solely for the purpose of strengthening Ukraine's defense against the background of growing aggressiveness from Russia. Martial law does not mean our retreat from the political-diplomatic settlement in the east. Today, I informed our western partners about this in detail. From the very morning, I have had detailed talks with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, with Polish President Andrzej Duda, since Poland represents Ukraine’s position and is the initiator of the consideration of the situation at the UN Security Council, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and with many others. Consultations will be continued this evening. And I can tell you that their attention to the situation in the east and directly in the waters of the Sea of ​​Azov has increased substantially. Today, we are heard much better than yesterday or the day before yesterday.
Dear friends, fellow Ukrainians.
Our joint responsibility, first of all mine, as of Supreme Commander-in-Chief, is to protect Ukraine. And Ukraine's defense is not only the defense of territory or military equipment. This is primarily the protection of people. We must be as prepared as possible for any action by our aggressive, volatile and, unfortunately, pretty unpredictable neighbor.
Of course, it is related to the protection of the right to free choice as well. Only a reliable defense, only doubling and tripling our defensive efforts guarantees peace that is needed, inter alia, for the conduct of the elections.
The NSDC recommended me today to introduce martial law for 60 days. I want to announce to you my decision - I will propose to the Parliament to introduce martial law for 30 days. For what? For martial law not to overlap with the beginning of the election campaign by a single day. So that no one of those who care for their party, their political interest more than for the nation and Ukrainian interest have a reason for dirty political speculations or insinuations.
Martial law will last 30 days and will end in mid-December. It is in December, in early December, that I will submit a draft resolution to the Parliament on the date of the presidential elections to be held in accordance with the Constitution on March 31, 2019. Period. As Supreme Commander-in-Chief, I will make every effort to stay within this short term and squeeze out the maximum opportunities from this month to increase our readiness to repel a possible full-scale offensive of the aggressor country - Russia.
Glory to Ukraine!"

Statement by the President in the Verkhovna Rada during the consideration of the amendments to the Constitution regarding the course on Ukraine's membership in the EU and NATO
",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vistup-prezidenta-u-verhovnij-radi-pid-chas-rozglyadu-zmin-d-51174,22 November 2018  - 18:38,"Dear Mr. Chairman!
Dear people’s deputies!
Fellow Ukrainians!
I have zero doubt that you will support the draft amendments to the Constitution in the first reading now. They, by force of the Basic Law, will oblige the Ukrainian authorities - any authorities and all its branches - to ensure Ukraine's accession to the European Union and NATO.
I do not see the arguments against the voting, do not understand them and do not accept them. And that's why. In four years we have overcome a huge distance on the path to European and Euro-Atlantic integration. As one of the European Commissioners said yesterday, Ukraine and the European Union have come closer than ever to each other - due to people who started the Revolution of Dignity five years ago. Let me add that no non-NATO member state has such close relations with the Alliance as Ukraine. This is also due to the people who started the Revolution of Dignity five years ago and who are sitting in this hall.
But if we take comparison with our neighbors as a basis, we are running extremely late and hang behind. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joined NATO in March 1999, and in May 2004, they joined the European Union, together with Slovenia, Slovakia and the Baltic States. And at that moment we have not even knocked on the door of the two most successful international unions! And in the very same year, we have disrupted the plan to chain Ukraine to a single Russian economic space at the cost of tremendous efforts.
The post-colonial society for a long time remained in captivity of imperial stereotypes and illusions, which have been flooding  here with the Kremlin propaganda for decades. Including the myths about allegedly fraternal Russia and supposedly aggressive NATO bloc. The political elite of that time, instead of going ahead and leading people, played along with crass prejudices.
Yes, there were politicians who thought strategically, who looked ahead, who saw threats and sought responses to them. At the end of 2000s, we made an attempt to spur our accession to NATO. There are a lot of witnesses and even participants of those events in this hall.
Some opposed openly. They have been blocking the work of the Verkhovna Rada for months; spreading disinformation in the media; ""opposition"" to NATO has been proclaimed the cornerstone of their policy. In short, they acted in the interests of Russia as a classical fifth column and actually they are doing the same now.
Others, although squeezing out words and even signatures in support of integration into NATO, have been quietly putting spokes in wheel, sending signals to the West that now is not the time for the MAP yet.
The then-government did not speak of its position on NATO in one voice and we lost the chance to secure ourselves from Russian aggression.
“In a number of neighboring states ... there have been repeated attempts to expand NATO, including by the so-called accelerated accession to the alliance of Georgia and Ukraine. All this, of course, required a clear and well-coordinated work of all the special power structures, law enforcement agencies and a very high level of coordination of their activities. I have to say that the Federal Security Service has successfully completed its tasks in whole”.
This is a message from the website ""kremlin.ru"" dated January 29, 2009. These are the original words of the then-president of Russia at the expanded FSB-KGB board. I have no questions to Russians. But how do those Ukrainian politicians, who at the end of the 2000s freely or non-freely took part in the named special operation, feel today? Who torpedoed Ukraine's accession to NATO and left the country vulnerable to Russian invasion.
I am deeply convinced that if we had been a member of the Alliance, Russia would not have dared annex Crimea and invade Donbas. And I note that the Kremlin launched an aggression against Ukraine when Yanukovych's regime proclaimed our non-alignment status.
In 2014, we returned the provision on Euro-Atlantic integration to the law on the principles of foreign and domestic policy. This swing, when the fundamental law is amended by a simple majority of votes, should be broken. And we will do it with amendments to the Constitution - with today's vote. I am hopeful and I am confident that I should unite this hall despite the political confrontation taking place today in Ukraine. And in February, at the next session, we will adopt the amendments to the Constitution once for all.
This is an additional guarantee from the revenge of the pro-Russian, anti-NATO, anti-European forces. I do not want to exaggerate the threat of such a revenge, but I also urge not to ignore it and not to underestimate it.
We must guarantee the inevitability of the European and Euro-Atlantic course. It is our responsibility to present and future generations.
By fixing in the Constitution the obligatory course of joining NATO and the European Union, we send a powerful message about the seriousness and irreversibility of our intentions to our partners on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Last week, by the way, a meeting of the Ukraine-US Strategic Partnership Commission was held  in Washington pursuant to my agreement with US President Donald Trump. And in the final statement, the US once again stressed that Ukraine would be in NATO. And in the summer, this prospect was documented in the final resolution of the NATO Brussels Summit, which confirmed the decision adopted in 2008 in Bucharest: the Alliance's doors for Ukraine are open. Dot! And in the summer, this prospect was documented in the final resolution of the NATO Brussels Summit, during which I personally participated in the Ukraine-NATO and Georgia-NATO commission. And among the 19 speakers, all 19 heads of state and government firmly urged to provide an immediate prospect of membership for Ukraine and Georgia, and confirmed the decision adopted in 2008 in Bucharest: the Alliance's doors for Ukraine are open.
Yes, not everyone is delighted with our perseverance in the west and many look back at Moscow just as they used to. But can this stop us?
By fixing in the Constitution the obligatory course of joining NATO and the European Union, we send a message to Moscow: we break up permanently and irrevocably. Russia as an aggressor country does not have and will not have a veto on our accession either to NATO or to the European Union. This is the sovereign right of Ukraine as a country that is confidently going its own way.
 
The issues of the European Union and NATO are very closely linked. These two organizations have somewhat different goals, but common values. And the membership criteria that we still have to achieve are very similar. Accession to the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance is a very ambitious task and its implementation is so difficult that it would be wrong to promise specific terms. But every day the hard work of the diplomats, the military and the whole country brings us closer to this goal, because the united Europe is our promised land. The land protected by a security umbrella, because NATO is the most effective, strongest and most organized collective security and defense system. During almost seven decades of NATO's operation, no country has dared attack any, even the smallest member of the Alliance.
I have repeatedly told that we are not heading to NATO with empty hands. In recent years, we have created a strong, capable army, which has a colossal experience of reflecting Russian aggression. Glory to the Ukrainian Army! It will substantially strengthen the Alliance's eastern flank. It implements an ambitious program of transition from Soviet to NATO standards in all areas of military construction - through an unprecedented number of joint exercises, the implementation of annual national programs, the achievement of compatibility of the entire security and defense sector.
The fact that in the east we are defending not only ourselves, but also the whole European civilization greatly enhances our moral right to apply for membership in the European Union as a full-fledged member.
We are currently focusing on the implementation of the Association Agreement and the Free Trade Agreement. We see how the exports of Ukrainian products to the European Union is constantly increasing. Last year, it grew by 30 percent, and this year by another 16 percent. The structure of exports is being gradually changed. Two days ago, during my meeting with business, the EU representative Hugues Mingarelli emphasized that in 2013, the share of the EU had equalled 25%. Now, it is 42%. This is a clear position about whom can we trust. Russia expected the imposition of embargo to have a ruining effect. For today, we demonstrate that Ukraine has radically changed the vectors of its industry in 4 years, re-oriented its exports. Our cooperation and DCFTA with the EU have been fully justified. We move from the sale of raw materials to the sale of processed industrial and agricultural products with added value. European companies, due to the lack of customs barriers, began to move production to us and create new jobs here.
Apart from the fact that the Agreement is a way of implementing our civilized choice, reorienting the economy to European and other markets has helped us overcome the deep socio-economic crisis caused by the war and economic blackmail of Russia. Russia closed its market, which was traditional for the sale of Ukrainian goods, which once absorbed a third of our exports. It wanted to strangle us economically, but made us stronger and more confident in our civilizational choice.
The past years have been and still are the time of great trials. The country has gone through a deep economic crisis, the reasons of which I have just recalled, and the level of living standards is being restored too slowly. Some inevitable reforms were too painful, but we could not but start them, because the consequences of the lack of these reforms would be even more difficult. Because of Russia's assault, we lost thousands and thousands of human lives, soldiers and civilians. A deep wound from these losses remains open and does not heal. The promise of quickly finishing the war did not come true and I publicly apologized to everyone for that.
However, we became more powerful as a nation, more confident in our strength, more solid in our intentions. We have strengthened our unity and strengthened our faith in our European future. Today, we cement this faith and confidence in the Constitution.
Today's vote is not an accidental episode. This is part of our strategy that we have been consistently implementing over the past four and a half years. Only Ukraine's integration into the Euro-Atlantic area guarantees us peace and security, independence and poverty alleviation.
We will not retreat from this strategy. Ukraine, going its own way, will definitely become a full member of NATO and a full member of the European Union.
Neither me, nor you, nor the majority of Ukrainians doubt that.
Glory to Ukraine!"

Statement by the President of Ukraine regarding the decision of the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate
",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zayava-prezidenta-ukrayini-u-zvyazku-iz-rishennyam-sinodu-vs-50346,11 October 2018  - 19:27,"Dear Ukrainians!
The Lord saw the struggle of the Ukrainian people for their independence. He heard our prayers. He properly estimated our labor. It became so desirable for Him to have His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and the Holy Synod of the Mother Church of Constantinople to declare the dreamed and long-awaited ""yes"", for which we fought for a long time.
There will be Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine.
The decision of the Ecumenical Patriarch and the Holy Synod has finally dispelled the imperial illusions and chauvinistic fantasies of Moscow, which were not supported by any legal church document - about Ukraine as so called ""canonical territory of the Russian Church"". It was in 1924 when the Ecumenical Patriarchate acknowledged the fact that the so-called ""transition"" of the Kyiv Metropolitan in the possession of Moscow took place ""not by the canonical rules"". And today the Holy Synod confirmed this position once again.
World Orthodoxy, as His All-Holiness Bartholomew once wrote, is a ""constellation of independent and equal national churches"". And finally, my dear friends, our Ukrainian star will shine in this constellation. The decision to grant Autocephaly has already been taken. I emphasize, that the decision to grant Autocephaly to Ukraine has been approved and confirmed once again.
By the work of God, their own Local Churches have been set up in all the Orthodox states that have won their independence. This happened in Bulgaria, in Greece, in Georgia, in Serbia, in Cyprus, in Romania, in Russia. Now our State of Ukraine is joining their ranks.
However, the question of Tomos and Autocephaly goes far beyond the church life, as the State has joined it. This is a matter of our independence. This is a matter of our national security. This is a matter of our statehood. This is a matter of the entire global geopolitics. This is the fall of the ""Third Rome"" as the most ancient conceptual claim of Moscow for the global domination.
Autocephaly is the part of our pro-European and pro-Ukrainian state strategy, which we have been consistently implementing over the past four years and, I emphasize, which we will implement hereafter. This is the foundation of our own path of development, the development of the State of Ukraine and the development of the Ukrainian nation.
Tomos is actually another Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine. The empire is losing one of the last levers of influence on its former colony.
For us, our own church is a guarantee of the spiritual freedom. This is the key to social harmony. I guarantee that the State of Ukraine will respect the choice of those who decide to remain in the church structure, which will maintain its unity with the Russian Orthodox Church. But I also guarantee that the state will protect the rights of those priests and believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, who voluntarily decide to leave the influence of Moscow to establish, along with the others, the Autocephalous Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
Today I can already say that the appeal to the Ecumenical Patriarch with the request to provide Autocephaly was supported by a group of Bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. They endured pressure, blackmail, threats and intimidation, yet they appealed with their signatures to the Ecumenical Patriarch. And this is worth acknowledgment.
I am grateful to Patriarch Filaret and all the Hierarchs of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kyiv Patriarchate, Metropolitan Macariy and the Bishops of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church for the spirit of unity which they demonstrated, and for their unanimous appeal to the Ecumenical Patriarch. I congratulate both Leaders on the fact that finally all the Moscow charges on them have been lifted. They have been recognized as the Canonical Bishops.
I want to express my special gratitude to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, which supported my appeal to the Ecumenical Patriarch concerning the establishment of the Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the provision of Autocephaly to the Ukrainian Church with the abundance of votes.
I want to thank every participant of the Procession on July 28, and all Ukrainians who strive for the Autocephalous Church and pray for it.
All together, we bow down to His All-Holiness Bartholomew for his care for Ukraine.
Your All-Holiness, Ukraine is looking forward to your pastoral visit to the people, which was baptized during the time of the Great Prince Vladimir.
Today we received the Autocephaly, and after the Council, the Primate of the Ukrainian Local Orthodox Church will obtain Tomos.
The Ukrainian government guarantees the full respect for religious freedom for the believers of all denominations. There is no state church, we never had it and there will never be one. And nobody will be ""invited by force"" to the Orthodox Church consecrated with Tomos.
Once again I emphasize that this is a matter of free choice for each believer.
The joint creation of an independent church cannot be the basis for discord, for confrontation, for violence. We certainly can't let it happen. On the opposite side, it is a road to peace, comfort and understanding.
As soon as you see people who will call up to take the Laurel, monastery or temple by force, you should know - they are the agents of Moscow. As the goal of the Kremlin is to fuel the religious war in Ukraine. And this is definitely not my plan, not the plan of the Ukrainian people and not the plan of the State of Ukraine.
Dear Ukrainians!
I sincerely congratulate you on this very grand historical event, and I am very grateful for the massive support of the idea that came about.
This is a great victory of the God-loving Ukrainian people over the Moscow demons, the victory of Good over Evil, the victory of Light over Darkness.
I congratulate everyone on this great day, for which the Ukrainian people have been waiting for 332 long years.
I congratulate you!
Glory to Ukraine!"

Statement by the President of Ukraine during the General Debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly 
",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vistup-prezidenta-ukrayini-na-zagalnih-debatah-73-yi-sesiyi-49938,26 September 2018  - 23:15,"Distinguished Madam President,
Excellences,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
On behalf of Ukraine, I congratulate Madam President on the election as President of the 73rd session of the General Assembly.
We support outlined priorities and are ready to do our share in translating them into reality.
Our deliberations are taking place at a defining moment for the Organization.
Despite the universal appeal for peace and declared commitment to uphold it, wars and armed conflicts remain our reality.
Conflicts are the main reason for the rise in refugees and displaced persons worldwide to the unprecedented figure of 65.5 million.
Since no peace means no development, hundreds of millions are doomed to misery.
The international security environment seemed rock-solid less than two decades ago. Now it has descended into a volatile and increasingly disturbing state where both traditional and hybrid threats are challenging stability of our societies.
Too often lofty rhetoric on peace, respect for international law, and commitment to human rights remains just that – rhetoric, nice sounding words, politically correct messages, which, however, are not backed by concrete actions.
We may become tempted to talk about achievements or grand plans for the future.
However, from our perspective, addressing fundamental problems that the UN and the international community as a whole face is much more important.
We shall never forget that the raison d’etre of this Organization is to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”.
Madam President,
Unfortunately, my fellow citizens have become a part of that one-fifth of the world population who is experiencing the horrors of war.
As I deliver my speech, reports have brought a sad news about another human life just lost on the frontlines of the war inflicted upon my country by the permanent member of the UN Security Council.
Yesterday, and the day before, several families, again, were struck by grief, as their loved ones perished under Russia’s hostile attacks.
Moscow turns Ukrainian to orphans. 
It tortures our patriots in its prisons.
Over 1.5 million people became internally displaced persons.
They still can’t return to their homes.
Russia constantly multiplies the human tragedy, which lately received a new dimension: ecological.
It poisons the Ukrainian soil and causes an environmental disaster not only in the occupied Crimea, but in Donbas as well.
This has been a daily reality for Ukrainians for four years now. Thousands of deaths, destruction, displacement and human suffering.
For my fellow citizens, these years have become a tremendous challenge – a test for their determination and solidarity, resilience and faith.
Let us not forget what this war is about.
Ukraine made a sovereign decision to live its way and promote the Free World based on democratic values and rules.
Russia punishes Ukraine for this decision.
It kills. It ruins homes. It lies on industrial scale.
It pretends that Ukraine, as well as Georgia “attacked themselves”.
Do we know which neighbor of Russia will “attack itself” next?
Or will the world be “comfortably numb” in a hope that “the next one won’t be me”?
As we defend Ukraine’s land and our free choice, as we counter the resurging neo-imperialist power willing to divide the world anew – we defend the Free World.
The UN shall not be silent, when the values and principles rooted in its Charter and the entire body of international law are being violated by a veto country.
This is not just a challenge, but our chance to make the United Nations relevant and to make the motto of this Assembly session work.
Madam President,
How did such a deterioration in the world affairs happen?
Many assumed that the respect for peace and international law is a constant given.
Developments on international stage over the last decade have seriously undermined this confidence.
Appeasement and quick fixes to difficult problems have proven to be a false option.
It has proven that staying comfortably silent when international norms are breached does not stop but encourages the offender to continue its destructive policies.
Your silence is exactly what the Kremlin weaponizes against Ukraine and, ultimately, against all of us!
It’s naïve to believe that safe shores will always be around.
There will be no safe shores, shall we allow someone to feel that HE is not bound by any norms or restrictions. That HE has a right to reshape the international system to his liking. That HIS interests are more legitimate than ours.
In the absence of a strong and united reaction, such extremely irresponsible and selfish actor resorts to the tactic of further escalation, creating new crises, raising the stakes, blackmailing other countries and even entire international organizations.
All in an effort “to get away with murder”.
We shall not allow this to happen. We shall bring the world back on track.
What is the cure?
In one word: responsibility.
The international community’s ability to ensure systemic and inevitable responsibility for each and every violation of international laws - first and foremost norms and principles of the UN Charter - is the benchmark indicating how successful we, as the family of nations, can be in achieving common goals.
Ensuring responsibility is never an easy feat.
Let me be clear on this point: Nothing will stop Moscow from continuing its aggressive expansionist policies if it does not face a united stand of the international community, if punishment for its actions does not become inevitable.
It is due to the lack of relevant punishment that after Georgia came Ukraine, that after Lytvinenko came Skrypals, that after Aleppo came Idlib…
Kremlin has no intention to stop. After occupation of Crimea, it aims now at occupation of the Sea of Azov between Ukraine and Russia.
Having illegally constructed a bridge across the Kerch Strait, Russia launched a systematic disruption of freedom of international navigation through the Kerch Strait for Ukrainian and foreign ships.
Such brutal actions must be rejected as illegal, including under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. They require a strong response, including an enhanced sanctions policy and other targeted measures.
Efficiency of international actions often falls short of expectations and the relevance of the United Nations itself is questioned.
We must admit that the responsibility for fixing the current state of affairs rests with all of us collectively and each of us individually.
If we are committed to building peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, we protect the UN Charter, uphold its norms and principles, take resolute action to restore justice.
Let me say it more precisely – the beautiful language of the Charter worth nothing if it is not enforced. No more words, time for deeds!
The United Nations must gain momentum as there are continued attempts to ruin the rules-based international order and revise internationally recognized state borders by force.
This dangerous slide towards the world with no civilized rules has to be stopped.
In this regard, there is a need to revitalize and strengthen the role of the General Assembly in the sphere of international peace and security.
With conflicts spreading, we have to ensure maximum flexibility and comprehensiveness of the agenda of the General Assembly, which is the only inclusive and chief policy-making forum.
That is why Ukraine introduced the item “The situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine” in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly.
Member States should be provided with every possibility for in-depth considerations of all urgent situations that require attention of the international community.
As outlined by the General Assembly President, we have to “facilitate quick and effective responses of the General Assembly to emergency situations”.
Ukraine, as one of Vice-Presidents of the 73rd session, stands ready to contribute to that.
As Member States, we “conferred on the Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security”.
What shall we do if a veto holding member of the Security Council uses this right not to help international peace and stability, but to help itself escape from responsibility?
It is time to say that the abuse of veto right is a brake that often does not allow our Organization to really act.
We believe that the progress on the Security Council reform will be an important contribution to the ongoing UN-wide change.
We support launching text-based talks within the Intergovernmental Negotiations and are ready to engage constructively in this process.
We also expect that the ongoing reform of the peace and security pillar envisaged by the Secretary-General, with the support of the General Assembly, would contribute to the speed and abilities of the Organization to react to the emerging threats to international peace and security.
Ukraine fully shares the approach of the Secretary-General on the peacekeeping activity of the Organization within his concept of the “Action for Peacekeeping (A4P)”. It is a timely opportunity for Member States and the UN leadership to consider measures leading to effecting real changes in the UN peacekeeping.
The very same peacekeeping that Ukraine has been asking the UN to deploy on its territory since April 2015, when I addressed my request, supported by the Parliament of Ukraine, to the President of the Security Council, to the President of the General Assembly and to the UN Secretary-General. 
After the failure of the UN to prevent aggression against Ukraine, we still hoped that the UN would help settling the conflict by deploying an UN-mandated multinational peacekeeping force in the occupied Donbas.
A mission, with a strong mandate and broad responsibilities to help bring peace on the Ukrainian soil. Rather than to freeze the conflict or cement the presence of the aggressor and its proxies in Donbas.
We firmly count on further progress on this important issue.
After all, and perfectly in line with the topic of this General Debate – “Making the United Nations relevant to all people” – it is through such a UN Security Council-mandated PKO that the UN would save countless lives and prevent further sufferings.
Madam President,
We remain as determined as ever to keep defending every inch of our territory against the aggression. At the same time, we will continue exploring all available means to end the conflict peacefully and restore the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
Let me stress – Ukraine has always put legal and diplomatic means of conflict resolution first.
We have prioritized multilateralism, by turning for support of the United Nations, OSCE, the Council of Europe and other international organizations, fora and mechanisms. And we will continue along that path.
Moscow shall feel the strength of the rule of international law.
We initiated several legal cases against the Russian side in international courts. On some of them we have already achieved important results.
In particular, in the beginning of 2017 the International Court of Justice (ICJ)  ordered Russia to lift the ban on activities on Mejlis – representative body of Crimean Tatars in the occupied Crimea.
However, Russia continues to ignore the ruling demonstrating its disregard not only to its international obligations but to the Court as well.
Another important element of our case in the ICJ it is the downing of MH17 in 2014 and the role of the Russian Federation in this tragedy.
It is important that Australia and the Netherlands recently joined Ukraine in its efforts to bring Russia to account.
The international community repeatedly calls Russia to acknowledge its responsibility and change its destructive behaviour in Ukraine and elsewhere.
We know that following the legal path is a lengthy process, but we are confident that at the end it will allow us to achieve justice.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It has been almost four years since Russia's attempted annexation and illegal occupation of Crimea and Sevastopol.
Under Russian occupation, Crimea has turned into a military stronghold threatening security and stability in the entire wider Black Sea region.
We believe that increasing militarization of Crimea deserves the General Assembly's close attention and prompt reaction.
Russia’s aggressive policies as well as its arrogance in using lethal weapons multiply the threat.
In this regard, Ukraine counts on your active support for the relevant resolution during this session.
Since the first day of the illegal occupation of Crimea, Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians have faced repressions and discrimination. There are many cases of murders, tortures, harassment and arrests under fabricated charges.
The list of hostages and victims of the Russian occupation regime in Crimea is getting longer almost every day.
The Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar identities seem to be a criminal offence in today’s reality of the occupied peninsula.
Crimean farmer Volodymyr Balukh was arrested and sentenced to 5 years in prison for raising a Ukrainian flag upon his private residence.
Crimean film director Oleg Sentsov remains behind the bars in a remote penal colony in northern Russia serving a 20-years prison term on fabricated charges.
Both Oleg and Volodymyr are balancing between life and death as they remain on a hunger strike.
I highly appreciate a remarkable manifestation of support and unity throughout the world to seek freedom for these brave persons.
Unfortunately, Kremlin remains blind and deaf to these appeals of the international community and many of Russia’s intellectuals.
I call upon UN Member States to strengthen their efforts in demanding respect for human rights in the temporarily occupied Crimea through the adoption of the respective UNGA resolution.
There are also dozens of Ukrainians held by the occupants in Donbas since the beginning of Russian aggression in 2014.
Ukrainian soldier Serhii Glondar has never seen his youngest daughter, as he has been held captive for three and a half years.
All Ukrainian proposals to exchange the Russian citizens convicted for crimes against our sovereignty and territorial integrity for the Ukrainian citizens held as political prisoners by Kremlin remained unanswered.
It’s just another side of Russia’s recklessness: first sending and inciting own citizens to this war – and simply abandoning them afterwards. 
This is the thing about today’s Russia: they don’t care.
They don’t care about suffering.
They don’t care about truth.
They don’t care about law.
They think that their military might and status in the UN give them this right.
It’s up to us to prove them wrong.
It’s up to us to MAKE THEM CARE.
Otherwise what’s the idea of us being here?
Otherwise what’s the difference between the era before the UN and with the UN?
In a broader context, Ukraine has always considered protection of human rights as one of the cornerstones of the UN activities.
Sustainable peace and security cannot be achieved in isolation from human rights.
We therefore support the efforts to bring back human rights issues to the UN Security Council and to promote close cooperation among all relevant UN bodies in this area.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
My country is delivering on its commitments under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals.
Ukraine’s economy grew in the second quarter of 2018 at a 3.8% annual rate. This marks the tenth straight quarter of growth that is a clearly sustainable trend. The GDP increase was helped by macroeconomic stabilization, improved investment climate and clean-up of the banking sector. 
Ukraine is demonstrating the best dynamics in growth among the emerging markets.
Despite heavy security and defense expenses totaling more than 6% of its GDP, Ukraine is undergoing fundamental transformations on social, economic and political tracks.
We have consistently implemented progressive reforms – ranging from judicial, education, healthcare, public administration reforms to carrying out decentralization and fighting corruption.
In 2019-2021, Ukraine will take over an important responsibility as member of the United Nations Economic and Social Council.
Based on its extensive recent experience, my country looks forward to using its membership to strengthen the role of the Council in following-up and reviewing 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals, particularly when it comes to conflict and post-conflict settings.
Among 17 Sustainable Development Goals Ukraine particularly welcomes the UN initiatives aimed at reducing global hunger.
Today, when more than 850 million people in the world are starving, my country cannot stand idle and is ready to offer the world its help in addressing the issue of food security.
Ukraine, like nobody, knows the price of this tragedy.
This November we will mark 85th Anniversary of one of the deadliest crimes of the 20th century – the crime of Holodomor, mass starvation in Ukraine artificially organized by the Stalinist regime. It took lives of several millions of Ukrainians.
In this regard, I would like to renew my appeal to the Assembly to mark one of the biggest tragedies in human history by adopting a dedicated declaration.
Madam President,
Our Organization is only as strong as we want and allow it to be.
Therefore, our full support and strong political will are required to ensure that the United Nations remains relevant in today’s uncertain and turbulent times.
Relevant, as you rightly put it in the theme of this debate, to all people.
It is our mission and shared responsibility to empower the United Nations to do what is expected of the Organization.
To do it through our global leadership based on shared values – freedom, the rule of law and tolerance.
Thank you for your attention."

President’s speech at the solemn Army Parade ""March of the New Army"" on the occasion of the 27th anniversary of the Independence of Ukraine

Dear guests!
These are the words of ""The March of the New Army"", which today will be heard for the first time during our military parade. It was created on the basis of the legendary song written in the late twenties of the last century. And it symbolizes the inextricable bond between different generations of fighters for freedom of the Homeland.
Last four and a half years have become a truly ""great hour"" for us, Ukrainians. We have experienced an incredible test of the war and economic crisis caused by Russian aggression. The enemy murdered thousands and thousands of Ukrainians - military and civilians; men, women, children. We were tested both for strength and fortitude. They tried to divide the people and dismember the country. They tried to block our movement to Europe. They wanted to drive the freedom-loving people back into the odious imperial stall.
Thank God and every Ukrainian for the fact that we withstood. And we have not only survived the bad times, but also strengthened muscles. We have become stronger and more confident in our own capabilities. We have laid the foundation for our progress with clear strategic reference points for the European Union and NATO for the future decades.
Fellow Ukrainians!
This year is special as we will celebrate the centenary of the independence of the Ukrainian People's Republic proclaimed by the IV Universal of the Central Council. The  centenary of the Act Zluky is approaching, when the UNR and ZUNR united in a single Ukrainian state. The Ukrainian national revolution, liberation competition of the beginning of the last century lasted about 4 hours, but the state was lost at that time. Our ancestors did not withstand in that war with Russia. Just as our Hetmans Ivan Vyhovsky and Ivan Mazepa did not withstand. The reasons were different, but the result is the same: long years of tragic dependence on the empire with repressions and holodomors. With the attempts to destroy Ukrainian language and dissolve the Ukrainian people on the boundless expanses of Eurasia.
Our generation faces the task to break the fatal historic circle. To ensure that Ukraine's independence is not measured by months or several years, as it was before. To prevent decades of mourning over the loss of the state and analyzing the reasons of another defeat. To be proud of victories and success of the state.
During four years of the war that Russia has unleashed against Ukraine, we have preserved and strengthened the state. The nation was consolidated on the principles of country protection and patriotism. We have created a strong army with you. And with the painstaking work of our diplomats, we have provided international political and diplomatic support for the independence of Ukraine.
The main thing is that we have firmly chosen our path of development. And we do not have the right to give it up in favor of external enemies and their agents inside the country.
First. We break all the bundles that connect us with the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. To make independence irreversible, make Ukraine great and strong, without any prospect of returning to the Russian influence zone - this is the main task of our generation. This is a task of the society and the authorities elected by it.
Second. We, Ukrainians, go our own way and understand that we must first of all rely on our own strengths. Use the wealth of the country in the interests of the people and the generations to come. Ukraine must firmly defend its national interests. External help is still important for us, but first of all we have to help ourselves.
Third. The strengthening of independence should take place in concrete steps. The visa-free regime for travel of Ukrainians to the European Union is valid for over a year. We inevitably become part of the European space. It strengthens our political independence.
The Association Agreement and the Free Trade Agreement with the European Union entered into force, and as a result, the share of exports to the EU is now almost 43%, compared with 32% four or five years ago. A clear European strategy has given us an opportunity to compensate for the huge losses that we suffered as a result of the politically motivated closure by Russia of its market and transit to third countries for Ukrainian goods. Russia will no longer be able to blackmail us because we have strengthened our economic independence.
Since the fall of 2016 - yesterday it was 1 thousand days already - we haven’t bought gas from Russia. Ukrainian ""Naftogaz"" brilliantly beat Gazprom in the Stockholm Arbitration, bringing $ 4.6 billion to the state pocket. That is how we gain our energy independence.
Fourth. There cannot be a free body, when the soul is in captivity. Let us be heard today in Constantinople, Moscow and the Vatican. We are determined to put an end to the unnatural and non-canonical dependence on the Russian church of a significant part of our Orthodox community. A church, which sanctifies Putin's hybrid war against Ukraine, prays day and night for the Russian government and for the Russian army.
Baptism came to us from the Constantinople Mother Church. And it is from Kyiv that it was spread all over Eastern Europe. Ukrainian Christianity has more than a thousand-year history, its own theological, liturgical and ecclesiastical tradition. Now that we have restored and defended the state independence of Ukraine with the capital in Kyiv, there is no reason why there should not be the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine equal to the other Autocephalous Orthodox Churches.
The issue of the Tomos on Autocephaly of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine goes far beyond religion. It is similar to the strengthening of the army, protection of the language, struggle for membership in the European Union and NATO. This is another strategic benchmark in our historic way. This is a significant component of our independence.
The integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic space is a reliable way to ensure security, development of Ukraine and decent living conditions for people. Such integration is one hundred percent guarantee of our independence. I want to emphasize separately - Europe needs us as well, because without us the European Union will not become a completed project. After all, the civilizational frontier of modern Europe lies along the north-eastern border of Ukraine.
On the continent, all those who are not blinded by Russian money understand that without European independent Ukraine, Europe would have less peace and security in Europe. Definitely less, not more. Without the restoration of territorial integrity and sovereignty of our state, all borders in Central and Eastern Europe will be uncertain.
The Russian war against Ukraine is part of the Kremlin's plan to ruin the European Union and NATO. Our warriors in the east defend security and prosperity not only in Ukraine, but also throughout Europe. So, we do not go to the European Union and NATO with empty hands,"" the Head of State emphasized. He added that Ukrainians would see once again that the Ukrainian army is one of the best armies on the continent. ""It will significantly strengthen NATO's eastern flank. And in return - we count on the guarantees of collective security provided by the Alliance.
Fellow Ukrainians!
Since you have entrusted me with the post of the President, the state compass is heading to the West - in the direction opposite to the empire. Its arrow has never flinched. And I assure you, it will not flinch as long as this compass is in my hands.
Moreover, I will insist on consolidating this aspiration to join the European Union and NATO in the Constitution. Lawyers found a formula for doing this optimally and quickly. By the opening of the autumn session of the Verkhovna Rada scheduled for September 4, my corresponding bill will have been registered. And I will work day and night, do everything for its approval.
The most reliable guarantors of Ukraine's independence and peaceful work of Ukrainians are Ukrainian warriors: the Armed Forces, National Guard, Navy, border guards, Security Service, police and other security structures. It's possible to speak about the changes in the Ukrainian army over the last four years at least for four hours - there is too much to tell. But it will be better than any words to see the confident march of heroes, the technology and weapons radiating strength and the skill of pilots.
People's army today reports to the Ukrainian people and we are proud of it. Everyone who joined its development, everyone who sent SMS with money in 2014, who left home and started working as a volunteer, soldiers - everyone can be proud of his own contribution to strengthening the defense capability.
Let us bow our heads to honor heroes who gave their lives for the peaceful future of Ukraine. Let us bow to every Ukrainian family that lost husbands, sons, mothers and sisters. Eternal memory to the Heroes deceased in the battles for our free, independent Ukraine. Eternal glory to them.
Please honor memory of the Ukrainian warriors and Ukrainian civilians fallen in the war unleashed by the Russian aggressor. We will never forget and never forgive.
Moment of silence.
Fellow Ukrainians!
Our Ukrainian Army is an army of peace. In the summer of 2014, it successfully liberated most of the Donbas from militants. And after the direct invasion of Russian regular troops, it firmly defends the country on the line of collision. It reliably protects Ukraine along the entire border with our aggressive neighbor.
The authorities did everything to reduce the impact of the war on society. I rejected the proposal to declare martial law that substantially restricted political rights and freedoms of citizens. Partial mobilization was replaced with formation of a contract army, reforms and peaceful construction are under way while more than 5% of GDP are spent on defense and security.
We strive for peace more than anything.
Nobody strives for peace more than us, Ukrainians.
The real peace will definitely come to our land. It is only a capable army that can provide peace and victory, and it is becoming more and more powerful day by day.
“The nation is alive until it is fighting,” Levko Lukyanenko, author of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, said. Today, Levko Hryhorovych would have turned ninety years old. We are all deeply grateful to the man-legend for his outstanding contribution to the struggle for the freedom of Ukraine and the freedom of its citizens.
Fellow Ukrainians!
You have just heard and seen that the Minister of Defense for the first time in history greeted the participants of the Parade with the words ""Glory to Ukraine!"". The strongest traditions are those that are born from the people. Generated by the people and human hearts, transmitted from generation to generation. Our symbols are not only the Flag, Emblem and Hymn that are written in the Constitution, but also the national slogan: ""Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the Heroes!"". We feel a colossal uplift from it, and our enemies avoid it like the devil avoids holy water. It has entered our lives, but now it's time to give it the power of law.
That is why I will submit to the Verkhovna Rada a bill on amendments to the military statutes, according to which this slogan will become the main greetings of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Happy twenty-seventh anniversary of the Independence of Ukraine!
Happy centenary of the revival of Ukrainian statehood!
Glory to the Ukrainian troops!
Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine!
Glory to the Ukrainian nation!
Glory to Ukraine!"
